# UAE Bargains - Community Deals Platform for UAE

> **Status:** Brainstorming Phase (Feb 2026)
> **Target MVP Launch:** March 3, 2026
> **MVP Duration:** 2 weeks

---

## Project Concept

A community-driven deals platform for UAE, enhanced by AI. Like OzBargain (Australia) but better — solving the problem of finding genuine bargains in a saturated coupon-aggregator market.

**Core Insight:** AI alone can't discover the best deals — human discovery is the soul. AI is the backbone, you need both.

**Product:** A Reddit-like platform where users post, vote, and discuss deals in UAE.

## Why This Idea

### The Problem

- UAE has NO true community-driven deals platform
- Existing players (The Entertainer, Cobone, Groupon.ae, Dubai Savers) are all:
  - Coupon aggregators OR
  - Retailer-sponsored listings (not true user deals)
- No "Reddit for UAE bargains" exists
- OzBargain (Australia) shows the model works:
  - Founded 2006 by Scott Yang (part-time for 4.5 years)
  - Ran alongside a full-time job for 5 years before going full-time
  - Now does ~$12.4M annual revenue with only 5 remote employees
  - Community-driven: users post deals, vote, discuss
  - 948,000 Australians visited in 4-week period (2015-2016 data)
  - Ranked #1 in Coupons & Rebates in Australia, #1,732 globally

### My Motivation

- I actively hunt for deals and bargains in my personal life — this isn't a business opportunity, it's a genuine habit
- The UAE has no true community platform where people share deals
- I want to build something in a space I actually care about: finding the best value for people

### Market Opportunity

- Dubai market is saturated with cheap developers
- Competing on price is not the play
- A product-led approach (community + AI) is unique
- Remote-friendly once established

## MVP Scope (2 Weeks - Due March 3)

**NOT Building (2-weeks total):**
- ❌ AI scraping engine
- ❌ Admin dashboards
- ❌ Notification systems
- ❌ Mobile app
- ❌ Deal verification systems
- ❌ Monetization features
- ❌ Instagram page

**Building ONLY:**
- ✅ Post a deal (title, description, price, original price, link or location, photo, category, expiry date)
- ✅ Upvote/downvote deals
- ✅ Sort by hot, new, top
- ✅ Deals organized by day (today's deals, with expiry logic)
- ✅ Basic categories (electronics, dining, fashion, groceries, travel)
- ✅ Comments on deals
- ✅ Simple user accounts

**Tech Stack:**
- React / Next.js + Supabase or Firebase for backend
- No overthinking: name, branding, or business model
- Just core features to get live

---

## Launch Plan

### Week 1 (By Feb 24)
- Build MVP (core features only)
- Seed with 20-30 real UAE deals before sharing with anyone
- Share with 15-20 friends in Dubai
- Realistically, ~3 friends might actively post deals
- **The goal: a live product with a link I can share**
- Not asking people to "join a startup" — just "here's a place to share deals"
- **Initial traction strategy:** ~30 fake users/agents to like, comment, and post deals — creates credibility illusion when site first launches

### Week 2 (By March 3)
- If platform has activity, iterate
- Add AI features (smart categorization, duplicate detection)
- If no activity, it's fine — cold start problem is real but gets solved with live product

### Simultaneously
- Wait on Sovereign Mind — stay responsive to Peyvand, don't chase
- Attend 2-3 AI/startup meetups in Dubai
- Don't touch Nourly

### If Savings Hit 100k AED
- Get a product role at an AI startup in Dubai. Not defeat — strategic repositioning.
- Keep building deals platform on side, like Scott ran OzBargain alongside a full-time job for 5 years.

## Cold Start Reality

Every community platform faces this. Reddit was seeded with fake accounts by founders. Scott posted OzBargain deals himself for years before community took over.

The cold start problem is real but gets solved with a live product, not a theoretical one.

## Inspiration & Research

### OzBargain Model (What Works)

**Founded:** 2006 by Scott Yang
**Why it works:**
- Community mechanics are the product: posting, voting, commenting
- Revenue: Google Ads + affiliate links for non-logged-in users
- Staff barely moderates
- 948,000 Australians visited in 4-week period (2015-2016 data)
- Ranked #1 in Coupons & Rebates in Australia, #1,732 globally

**Key Insight:** The north star question: *"How do I make someone excited to post that $90 AED Adidas find?"*
- **The answer:** Posting a deal that gets upvotes feels good
- There's reputation, voting, comments, competition
- **The community mechanics ARE the product**

### UAE Market Context

- No Reddit equivalent for UAE bargains
- No Facebook groups dedicated to deals (only buying/selling)
- WhatsApp groups: fragmented, not searchable
- Existing "deal" platforms are just coupons or retailer lists

### Target User Behavior

- UAE residents actively hunt for deals (I know this from personal habit)
- Want to verify authenticity
- Want to share good finds
- Will post/vote/comment if community has energy

## Comparison with Nourly

| Aspect | Nourly | UAE Bargains |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Business Model** | B2B2C marketplace | C2C deals platform |
| **Revenue Model** | 15% commission | Ads + affiliate links |
| **Ticket Size** | $5,000+ per booking | Free/low value deals |
| **Stakeholders** | Retreat partners (complex) | Individual users (simple) |
| **My Role** | Partnership/operations/product | Product/AI builder |
| **Passion** | Low (don't care about wellness) | High (love finding deals) |
| **My Fit** | Poor (wrong role) | Strong (builder mindset) |

## Honest Assessment

**Why This Suits Me Better:**

1. **I love building.** This is product work I genuinely enjoy.
2. **Solo challenge:** But I need to acknowledge I need a co-founder for ops
3. **Market-driven:** Building around real user behavior (people hunt for deals), not my own assumptions
4. **AI + Community:** Matches my skills perfectly (product + AI) while leveraging human discovery
5. **Low overhead:** No partnership management, no retreat sales, simple users
6. **Clear path to MVP:** 2 weeks to live, no overthinking features

**Potential Issues:**
- Will need to actively seed content initially (cold start risk)
- Community takes time to build
- Ads revenue depends on traffic
- Monetization path unclear beyond ads

## Next Steps

1. **Build MVP (Feb 18-24)**
2. **Seed with real UAE deals**
3. **Share with friends**
4. **Monitor activity**
5. **If no traction by March 3:** Pivot or add AI features
